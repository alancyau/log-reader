# log-reader
Log reader for 2022+ Subaru WRX. Provides overall health of the engine, such as, engine air fuel corrections and knock detection.

To run the tool:
```bash
python3 readlog.py datalog1.csv
```

This tool will also work for the 2015-2021 WRX but will require updating the monitor column names.
